# Conformance

The current implementation of the container registry does _not_ fully conform to the [Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/master/spec.md).

It is tested manually with both Docker and containerd, but it would be nice to make the conformance tests pass to get some assurance that things work as intended.
